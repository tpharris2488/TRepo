            <h2>Mitsu Metamorphosis
                <p>The Mitsubishi Evo is not a <span>car</span>—it’s a weapon, one whose roots can be traced back to well before the dawn of the nameplate. In Mitsubishi’s almost ceaseless quest to establish an image for itself, racing has been a priority on several occasions. As far back as 1961, the company was aiming for rally glory with its 500 Super Deluxe, which was developed for racing with its “big” 594-cc, 25-hp, air-cooled, two-cylinder engine. At the 1962 Macau Grand Prix, examples finished first, second, and third (plus fourth) to lock out every other manufacturer from the “Under 750 cc” class podium. By the early 1970s, Mitsu had developed the Lancer 1600GSR that took the top spot in 1974’s tough East African Safari Rally. And in 1985, a Mitsubishi Pajero SUV (sold as the Montero in the United States) won the Paris-Dakar Rally.</p>

            <h2>History of the Toyota Soarer</h2>
            <p>The Toyota Soarer was a luxory coupe sold by Toyota, Japan from 1981 to 2004. The Soarer launched in 1981, releasing the Z10 series. In 1986 the more rounded Soarer was released, the Z20 series. In 1991 the Z30 series was released. The Z30 Soarers were also released in America, but under the Lexus name tag, the SC300/400. While the Lexus SC shared many components and the same body style, the Z30 Soarer offered different powertrain specs and different vehicle configurations. In 2001 Toyota released the Z40, a convertible known here in the states as the Lexus SC430. In 2005 Lexus was introduced in Japan and the Soarer line was discontinued, and the Lexus SC 430 was now available in Japan.</p>

            <h2>Nissan Stagea History</h2>
            <p>There are 3 different versions of the Stagea, WC34 Series 1 (1996 to late 1998), WC34 Series 2 (late 1998 to 2001) and the M35 Series (2001 to 2007). I have a Series 1 RS4.
            
                The Stagea is commonly referred to as the Skyline wagon (because it shares many mechanical parts as the R33 Nissan Skyline and Nissan Laurel) is a station wagon originally produced by Nissan in 1996.</p>
